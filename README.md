# **American Indian Language Dictionaries in Digital Archives: Adaptive Learning Models for Archival Description**  

## **Overview**  
This repository explores the methodologies and frameworks used in creating **American Indian language dictionaries** for digital archives. It presents an improved model for **automated archival processing**, comparing **adaptive learning models** with traditional human processing to enhance archival descriptions. The broader implications for **large-scale digital projects** and the future of **archival science** are also discussed.  

With advancements in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning**, the ability to **process large volumes of typewritten and handwritten text** within minutes—rather than days or months—represents a **transformative leap** in digital archival science. By refining **text analysis, entity recognition, and terminology control**, this model accelerates **metadata standardization**, making historical records **more accessible and meaningful**.

## **Objectives**  
This project aims to:  
- **Develop and improve dictionaries for American Indian languages** within archival frameworks.  
- **Implement adaptive learning models** to process and interpret archival descriptions.  
- **Standardize terminology** across digital archives while preserving **unique tribal distinctions**.  
- **Enhance entity recognition**, linking **historical events, policies, and individuals** in American Indian history.  
- **Improve metadata accuracy** through **feedback loops** that refine machine learning predictions over time.

## **The Role of Adaptive Learning in Archival Science**  
Traditional archival **description and metadata creation** rely heavily on **manual human input**, which can be **inconsistent, biased, and time-consuming**. **Adaptive learning models** enhance this process by:  

- **Accelerating Text Processing**: Automating the recognition of **entities, subjects, policies, and people**.  
- **Refining Controlled Vocabularies**: Standardizing terminology (e.g., American Indian vs. Native American vs. Muscogee’).  
- **Enhancing Metadata Linkage**: Strengthening connections between records and ensuring **semantic relationships** between terms.  
- **Detecting Patterns in Archival Texts**: Identifying **key themes, dates, and historical context** through NLP techniques.  

### **Challenges Addressed by the Model**
- Inconsistent terminology across archival collections.  
- Difficulty in recognizing **handwritten or typewritten documents**.  
- Inaccurate metadata due to **human cognitive biases**.  
- Challenges in identifying **ceremonial, legal, or political references** in tribal history.  

**Solution:** Our model improves accuracy by integrating **Named Entity Recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, and entity-linking techniques** to **detect, categorize, and interconnect** important archival information.

## **Key Technologies & Methodologies**  

### **1. Controlled Vocabularies and Language Libraries**  
- Standardized dictionaries ensure **consistent data annotation**.  
- Language models are trained to **recognize, classify, and translate** diverse terms.  
- Example: **‘Mvskoke’ vs. ‘Muscogee Creek’**—ensuring all related documents are linked under the same classification.  

### **2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques**  
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies names, organizations, locations, and historical terms.  
- **Topic Modeling**: Groups related documents by themes (e.g., treaties, sovereignty, land policies).  
- **Text Classification**: Maps documents to predefined **controlled vocabularies** for **better searchability**.  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detects **contextual tone** (e.g., legal proceedings vs. personal correspondence).  
- **Entity Linking**: Connects references within texts to **historical events, people, and organizations**.  

### **3. Feedback-Loop Controls**  
- Ensures **continuous model improvement** through automated re-training.  
- Allows **human reviewers** to refine machine predictions.  
- Differentiates between **literal and figurative language** (e.g., ‘Chief’ as a tribal leader vs. a government title).  

**Example**: If a **satirical** remark appears in congressional records, the system flags it for review to prevent misinterpretation.

## **Metadata Standardization & Data Linkage**  
To ensure **archival consistency**, this project creates **standardized metadata feedback loops**:

 **Process Flow:**  
- **Extract** terms from historical documents.  
- **Compare** against controlled vocabularies.  
- **Identify relationships** across archival records.  
- **Normalize metadata** while preserving original text.  
- **Validate accuracy** using human feedback.  

**Improved Record Linkage**:  
- By **unifying terminology**, the system **prevents fragmentation** and strengthens archival metadata. For example:  
	- *Muscogee Creek* → *Mvskoke* (Linked under a standardized term).  
	- *Indian Affairs Act (1978)* → *Referenced in multiple congressional records*.

## **Why It Matters for American Indian Language Preservation**
- Many Indigenous languages remain **underrepresented** in digital archives.  
- Adaptive models can **preserve, translate, and classify** historical linguistic data.  
- Recognizing **tribal sovereignty** through accurate **archival description** is vital for historical justice.  
- Automated archival processing ensures **faster access** to cultural records for **Indigenous communities, researchers, and educators**.  

---

## **Future Directions**
- **Expanding NLP models** to cover additional **tribal languages and dialects**.  
- **Integrating AI-powered handwriting recognition** to process handwritten American Indian documents.  
- **Building interactive digital dictionaries** for Indigenous language preservation.  
- **Collaborating with Indigenous scholars and communities** to refine data representation.
