# Archival Metadata Standardization with Indigenous-Led Controlled Vocabulary

## Overview
This project is dedicated to the standardization of archival metadata through a **closed AI network utilizing a controlled vocabulary focused exclusively on Indigenous-reviewed and Indigenous-published materials**. Unlike traditional AI models that scrape information from the open internet, my model operates entirely within a curated, closed environment to ensure accuracy and integrity (Pryse, 2024).

The goal is to preserve and contextualize Cherokee language (ᏣᎳᎩ - Tsalagi) and historical records, to identify viable acrhival data to describe important historical records. This allows the Center in eliminating outdated or offensive terminology in archival descriptions (Protocols for native american archival materials 2024).

## AI Network & Indigenous Data Integrity: A Closed, Curated AI Model
This model **does not rely on internet-based AI models or external large language models (LLMs)** that pull uncontrolled, biased, or historically inaccurate data. Instead, it functions within a self-contained ecosystem of controlled metadata, developed and maintained in-house through tribal archival collaboration, Indigenous scholarship, and historical accuracy reviews.

### Relationships Between Words, Tribes, Leaders, and Legislation
Rather than treating Indigenous terminology in isolation, the model is designed to recognize and relate key terms within their appropriate historical, legal, and cultural contexts. These relationships are curated, structured, and validated using Indigenous-authored materials and archival best practices. The controlled vocabulary and entity relationships include:

#### **Tribal Names & Language Variations:**

- "Cherokee" ↔ "Tsalagi" ↔ "Keetoowah"
- "Muscogee" ↔ "Mvskoke"
- "Osage" ↔ "Wahzhazhe"

#### **Tribal Leaders & Governance Context:**

- "Pleasant Porter" ↔ "Talof Harjo" ↔ Principal Chief of the Creek Nation
- "John Ross" ↔ "Guwisguwi" ↔ Cherokee Nation Chief (1828–1866)
- "Wilma Mankiller" ↔ First Female Chief of the Cherokee Nation (1985–1995)

#### **Geopolitical & Historical Markers**

- "Indian Territory" ↔ "Oklahoma" ↔ "ᎠᏰᏟ" (Ayetli - Cherokee for 'land beyond')
- "Trail of Tears" ↔ "ᎠᏁᎬᏓᏅᏙᎢᎦ" (Anegvdadanvdoiga - ‘the place where they cried’)

#### **Legislative & Policy References**

- "Indian Self-Determination Act" ↔ Federal Policy (1975) on tribal sovereignty
- "Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831)" ↔ U.S. Supreme Court case impacting tribal sovereignty
- "Major Crimes Act (1885)" ↔ Legislation impacting tribal judicial authority

#### Contextualization & Controlled AI Learning

The AI model is trained using Named Entity Recognition (NER) and semantic contextualization to relate people, places, and policies appropriately. 

#### Disambiguation of Terms:
- "Chief" in tribal governance ≠ "Chief" in fire or police departments
- "Indian Affairs" in federal policy ≠ "Indian Affairs" in tribal governance
- "ᏣᎳᎩ" (Tsalagi) ≠ "Cherokee" (as used in colonial legal records)



### Human Oversight 
All metadata processing and AI training are subject to human review by Indigenous archivists, historians, and linguistic experts. The model is not an autonomous decision-maker—***it is a tool for structured assistance***, helping refine and streamline metadata consistency while ensuring Indigenous sovereignty over information representation.

### Key Features & Next Steps
- ***Expansion of Controlled Vocabulary:*** Continued tribal engagement to refine terminology and linguistic relationships.
- ***AI Bias Detection & Mitigation:*** Ongoing human-led reviews to prevent misclassification and reinforce ethical standards.
- ***Integration into Archival Systems:*** Custom APIs and datasets for use in tribal archives, libraries, and museums.

### Conclusion
This project represents a fundamental shift in archival metadata standardization, centering Indigenous voices, linguistic structures, and historical truths. By creating a closed AI network governed exclusively by Indigenous-reviewed materials, we ensure that history is documented accurately, respectfully, and in alignment with tribal knowledge systems.
